# Recoil
A "the floor is lava"-like endless survival game about movement through untraditional means: "unrealistic gun recoil" - just make sure you don't run out of ammo.

Score is gained by simply staying alive, and picking up coins. You can also pick up buffs which can change some of game's properties, such as Anti Gravity.

This is my first real game project and hence it is my first time using Monogame.
